<h1>Alabaster Linux</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aquefir/alabaster">Source code</a></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>One liner:</strong><br/>
wget -O- -UwUget alabaster.sh | sh</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Alternative syntax for RHEL-based
distros:</strong><br/>
curl -fsSL alabaster.sh | sh</p>
<p>
Note that installing and using wget will not work on RHELs as their
version apparently does not follow redirects.
</p>
<h2>GUI setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download a compatible GNU/Linux distro:
<ul>
<li>Debian 10 (buster)</li>
<li>Debian 11 (bullseye)</li>
<li>Debian 12 (bookworm)</li>
<li>Arch Linux</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boot into it and install it</li>
<li>Follow setup according to your desires, but: on Debian, <strong>deselect all apt packages except for "standard system utilities"</strong>. Do NOT install a desktop environment!</li>
<li>Log in as root using the password you set during installation.</li>
<li>Run the one-liner up top!</li>
<li>Once it completes, run reboot and log in normally.</li>
</ol>

you would like to contribute an equivalent package list to save time
for others, please reach out by emailing postmaster at this domain.

<h3>Other data</h3>
<p>
Fumaca 2 is the Openbox window theme in use. SkeuOS (grey, dark) is
the GTK+ UI theme. Papirus Dark is the icon theme, and Breeze Snow is
the cursor theme.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
It is helpful to have a curated software environment that provides
consistent behaviour across space and time. To this end, Alabaster
Linux is a 'pseudo-distro' that sets up using a suite of scripts on
top of a clean installation of either Debian 10 (Buster) or CentOS 7.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Developing and maintaining Alabaster as a 'proper' Linux distribution
is more work and has other practical downsides; for example, ISOs
would have to be made, and specific accomodations would need to be
made for various architectures. Our approach lets us ignore all of
that stuff and just set up Debian as it comes, be it on AMD64,
AArch64, RISC-V, or whatever Debian supports. We only need to make
sure the software we author works across these support targets, which
is part of why Alabaster is needed!
</p>
<h2>Licencing</h2>
<p>
The Alabaster install script from alabaster.sh (this website) is
licenced under the <a href="https://aquefir.co/asl"
target="_blank">Artisan Software Licence, version 1.1</a>. The
contents it installs are licenced under their respective licences;
consult the contents of the installation script to find out which
projects are brought in and what their licences are.
