<h1>Alabaster Linux</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/aquefir/alabaster">Source code</a>
</p>
<hr />
<h2>One liner</h2>
<p class="pre">wget -O- -UwUget alabaster.sh | sh</p>
<h3>Alternative syntax for CentOS 7</h3>
<p class="pre">curl -fsSL alabaster.sh | sh</p>
<p>
Note that installing and using wget will not work on CentOS as their version
apparently does not follow redirects.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download either CentOS 7 minimal or Debian 10 (Buster) netinst</li>
<li>Boot into it and install it</li>
<li>Follow setup according to your desires, but <strong>deselect all apt
packages excxept for standard system utilities</strong>. On CentOS, make sure
to set the root password.</li>
<li>Log in as root using the password you set during installation.</li>
<li>Run the one-liner up top!</li>
<li>Once it completes, run reboot and log in normally.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Package lists for other distributions</h3>
<p>
<strong>Arch Linux core:</strong> wget curl autoconf automake binutils bison
flex gcc gettext libtool make patch perl-pkgconfig emacs-nox expat openssl zlib
perl zip unzip sudo lz4 asciidoc docbook2x
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arch Linux graphical:</strong> feh lightdm openbox terminator gmrun

If there are other distros that you use which aren't listed here, and you would
like to contribute an equivalent package list to save time for others, please
reach out by emailing postmaster at this domain.

<h3>Other data</h3>

Fumaca 2 is the Openbox window theme in use. SkeuOS (grey, dark) is the GTK+ UI
theme. Papirus Dark is the icon theme, and Breeze Snow is the cursor theme.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
It is helpful to have a curated software environment that provides consistent
behaviour across space and time. To this end, Alabaster Linux is a
'pseudo-distro' that sets up using a suite of scripts on top of a clean
installation of either Debian 10 (Buster) or CentOS 7.
</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Developing and maintaining Alabaster as a 'proper' Linux distribution is more
work and has other practical downsides; for example, ISOs would have to be
made, and specific accomodations would need to be made for various
architectures. Our approach lets us ignore all of that stuff and just set up
Debian as it comes, be it on AMD64, AArch64, RISC-V, or whatever Debian
supports. We only need to make sure the software we author works across these
support targets, which is part of why Alabaster is needed!
</p>
<h2>Licencing</h2>
<p>
The Alabaster install script from alabaster.sh (this website) is licenced under
the <a href="https://aquefir.co/asl" target="_blank">Artisan Software Licence,
version 1.1</a>. The contents it installs are licenced under their respective
licences; consult the contents of the installation script to find out which
projects are brought in and what their licences are.
